# puns
A repository of puns on a variety of topics

## Organization
A file should be created for each topic. Inside list different puns for the 
related topic. It should be in markdown format.

If there are jokes that are a bit off-color, place those in a file of the same 
name but add `-nsfw` on the end. (Ex: off-color puns about fruit might go in 
`fruit-nsfw.md`)

Within each file, there should be a header (use `#`) and a brief description. For example:
> # Fruit
> Puns based on all kinds of delicious fruit

Then list puns with bullets (use `-`). Feel free to divide these into additional categories (with `##`):
> ## Banana-specific
> - I love bananas. They're so appealing.
>
> ## Fruit juice
> - I heard the apple stopped in the road because it ran out of juice.
